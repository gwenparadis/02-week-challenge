#02-Week-Challenge (Portfolio)

## Description

I created this portfolio in order to begin to showcase my work as a web developer and increase my chances of employment. This project showcases the skills that I have learned in Advanced CSS, as well as other projects that are linked in the Work section. This allows my work to be accessed quickly and easily from one location. I learned how to apply Advanced CSS to a functional webpage.
