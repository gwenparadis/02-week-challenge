            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> My name is Gwen Paradis and I am an aspiring Junior Software Engineer. I have been enrolled in a
                JavaScript-focused bootcamp since August 2022 and have completed training in HTML5, CSS3, and some
                JavaScript. Prior to my technological training, I obtained a Bachelors of Social Work with a minor in
                Biology, and have been working in community program development and community-based social work since
                2015. Although I love my work with youth and families, my fascination with science, mathematics, and
                technology led me to completing research and training in computer coding and web development. I am
                excited to shift
                my career into a field that thrives off of problem-solving, creativity, and innovation, all from the
                safety
                of an office or remote work setting. These are skills I have adapted and maintained as a social worker
                and
                fuel my interest in technologies that both captivate and serve their users for years to come.
