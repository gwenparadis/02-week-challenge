        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Gwendelyn Paradis and I am an aspiring Junior Software Engineer. I have been enrolled in a JavaScript-focused bootcamp since August 2022 and have completed training in HTML5, CSS3, and some JavaScript. Prior to my technological training, I obtained a Bachelors of Social Work with a minor in Biology, and have been working in community program development and community-based social work since 2015. Although I love my work with youth and families, my fascination with science, mathematics, and technology led me to completing research and training in computer coding and web development. I am excited to shift my career into a field that thrives off of problem-solving, creativity, and innovation, all from the safety of an office or remote work setting. These are skills I have adapted and maintained as a social worker and fuel my interest in technologies that both captivate and serve their users for years to come.</p>
